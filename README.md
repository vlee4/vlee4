# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victoria.
I'm a former pharmacy technician turned software developer. And long story short, I decided to learn coding because I was inspired by the impact technology can make in virtually every industry. So many helpful and inspiring tools have already been made through coding. I want to be part of the movement that continues to create and develop the tools that will help us help others.

### I've worked with the following:
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Firebase (Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, Hosting), Scala, Thrift, React Testing Library, Storybook.js
### I've dabbled in:
- TypeScript, Python, Flask, MongoDB, SQL, Figma, TensorFlow, Jest, GraphQL
### I'm interested in learning more about:
- TypeScript, Python, Webpack, Babel, AI/ML, Accessibility, Azure, Docker
