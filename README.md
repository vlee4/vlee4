# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victoria.
I'm a former pharmacy techniacian turned full-stack web-developer. And long story short, I decided to switch career paths because I was inspired by the impact technology can make in virtually every industry. So many helpful and inspiring tools have already been made through coding. I want to be part of the movement that continues to create and develop the tools that will help us help others.

### I've worked with the following languages / technologies:
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Firebase (Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, Hosting)
